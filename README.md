# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mateusz Marko, a second-year student of Information Systems and Automation at Wroclaw University of Technology. I am passionate about various programming disciplines including data structures, algorithm design, and machine vision. Proficient in C, C++, and Python, I am enthusiastic about leveraging these skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on enhancing my skills in general computer science, robotics and automation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm continuously learning and improving my expertise in programming languages by projects.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to work on any projects that push the boundaries of technology.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about anything.

## I'm currently working on projects related to my university courses:

- **Algorithm Design and Analysis**: Developing efficient algorithms to solve complex problems.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing and testing different data structures and operations on them.

## Experience:

As a student at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, I have already engaged in a variety of courses and pursued personal interests that have enhanced my expertise in several key areas of computer science:

- **Data Structures Implementation**: Creating and optimizing various data structures to improve program efficiency. This includes hands-on experience in implementing trees, graphs, and hash tables as part of my coursework and independent projects.

- **Algorithm Efficiency Analysis**: Analyzing and enhancing the performance of algorithms in different scenarios. My studies have included detailed work on sorting and searching algorithms, complexity analysis, and algorithm optimization for better efficiency.

- **Machine Vision Applications**: Extensive operations on images for various machine vision applications, including rotation, denoising, mosaicking, demosaicking, and scaling. These projects not only honed my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of how theoretical concepts apply in practical scenarios.

These experiences stem from both my academic curriculum and my drive to explore areas of interest within the field of computer science, demonstrating a well-rounded skill set and a proactive approach to learning.


## Projects and Repositories:

- **Algorithm Design and Analysis**: A repository showcasing my work on designing and analyzing algorithms. This includes practical implementations and theoretical explorations.
