# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mateusz Marko, a second-year student of Information Systems and Automation at Wroclaw University of Technology. I am passionate about various programming disciplines including data structures, algorithm design, and machine vision. Proficient in C, C++, and Python, I am enthusiastic about leveraging these skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on enhancing my skills in general computer science, robotics and automation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm continuously learning and improving my expertise in programming languages by projects.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to work on any projects that push the boundaries of technology.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about anything.

## I'm currently working on projects related to my university courses:

- **Algorithm Design and Analysis**: Developing efficient algorithms to solve complex problems.
- **Machine Vision in Python**: Creating programs using Pandas, Scikit-image, Matplotlib, and other tools to process and analyze visual data.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing and testing different data structures and operations on them.

## Experience:

- **Data Structures Implementation**: Creating and optimizing various data structures to improve program efficiency.
- **Algorithm Efficiency Analysis**: Analyzing and enhancing the performance of algorithms in different scenarios.
- **Machine Vision Applications**: Operations on the image, any kind of rotation, denoising, mosaicking, demosaicking or scaling up.

## Projects and Repositories:

- **Algorithm Design and Analysis**: A repository showcasing my work on designing and analyzing algorithms. This includes practical implementations and theoretical explorations.
